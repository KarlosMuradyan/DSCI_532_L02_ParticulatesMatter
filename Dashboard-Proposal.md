## Section 1:  Motivation and Purpose

It is a well-known fact that air quality affects human health. Lots of studies have been made and proved this statement. It is estimated that around seven million people die each year worldwide because of air pollution. PM2.5, for example, is one of the types of particulate matter, which is so small that it can bypass the nose and throat of animals and humans and penetrate the deeper layers of the lungs. One of [the studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11879110) estimated that for every $10(Î¼g/m^3)$ increase of this matter in the air increases the risk of cardiopulmonary and lung cancer about 4%, 6% and 8%. PM2.5 and PM10 (same PM2.5 but slightly larger) can also cause bronchitis, asthma, some forms of heart diseases, etc.

Another known fact is that the consumption of energy, transport, air conditioning, heating, and other things cause an increase in PMs. But how to know which areas have the highest concentration? Knowing the concentration of these matters in given areas can help to investigate the causes of air pollution, take actions against it and reduce the risk of health issues. Our dashboard provides an easy-to-use platform where a user can investigate the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matters in available areas and dates. The user has a chance to change the location, choose timestamps in the interactive charts and compare two or more locations together.
