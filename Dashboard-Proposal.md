# Dashboard Proposal

## Section 1:  Motivation and Purpose


## Section 2 Description of the data

## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios


- Do concentration levels of PM10 and PM25 follow a similar trend?
- Do concentration levels of PM10 and PM25 exhibit seasonality, and are there any consistent patterns?
- Is there a particular season of the year which is characterized by the highest pollution levels?
- What is the range of average PM10 and PM25 concentrations in a given year?
- What locations, or clusters of locations, have the highest concentration of pollutants? 
- Which location has the highest rate of increase in pollutant concentration?



The main point of the dashboard is to inform clients on how pollution has changed over time as well as where the pollution is most intense. 

Dave, BC’s  Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment, is hoping to better understand the air quality situation in Greater Vancouver. Recently, he had been informed by the Ministry of Health that there have been increasing cases of respiratory health problems along coastal locations in Vancouver. They suspect air quality to be a potential factor in this rise, so they ask Dave, the Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment, for a report on the current state of air quality in the region.  to track whether air quality is under control. He is particularly interested in what locations are most in need for interventions to lower pollutant concentration in the air. Our app, “Pollutants Matter BC”, is focused on delivering Dave methods of visualization to help inform him of important trends and patterns. For example, he may be specifically interested in the air pollution of coastal areas. He may hypothesize that coastal areas have seen a rise in air pollution in the past decade. Using the apps features to selectively toggle data for locations of interest, Dave will easily be able to track how PM10 and PM2.5 have changed over the years. Furthermore, he will be able to pinpoint which coastal areas are in the worst shape so that urgent action can be taken to reverse any worrying trends.
