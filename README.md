# DSCI 532: Group 215 - ParticulatesMatter

Members: Tejas Phaterpekar, Karlos Muradyan, Jarome Leslie

Dataset: Time series of particulate matter concentrations across BC





## Description

In our app, we plan to have four plots that give different insights into the air pollution situation in the Greater Vancouver area. We will have a time-series plot that tracks pollutant concentration over time. The user can use drop-down menus to allow for flexibility in what pollutant type and location they wish to observe. The second time-series plot will be similar to the first, except it will feature only one location (selected by the user) and will show the trend of both types of pollutants over time. Importantly, the time range of the plots will be controlled by the user through a range slider. The third plot will contain the distributions of pollutants for user-selected locations. The histogram will be shaded according to which years are selected on the time range slider bar. Finally, we will have a heatmap that highlights all locations in the study. The user can select which pollutant they wish to observe and if they hover their mouse over a location on the heatmap, they will be able to see pollutant concentration values. Adjusting the slider bar will highlight regions of the heatmap accordingly, while greying out the rest.
